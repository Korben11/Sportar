            <p>Hello, we are Linh Hoang and Juraj Korbacka, we are ICT students of Fontys Hogeschool in Eindhoven.
            This website is part of our subject that we are following (WEB1).
            This website is underbuilt therefore you may find some functions are missing or not working properly.
            The main ideas of making this website are practicing html, css and php in the future.</p>        
            <p>There are a few things that we have generated on the website:</p>
            
            <ul class="unlisted">
                
                <li>Login/register buttons alow you to make an account.</li>
                <li>Navigation bar: contains links to different pages within the organization.</li>
                <dd>-"Shop" page: Pictures of products (just for demonstration therefore there's no actual product).</dd>
                <dd>-"Visit" page: Contains an embed google map which works perfectly.</dd>
                <dd>-"Account" page: Not sure what we're going to put here yet.</dd>
                <dd>-"Home" page: This page.</dd>
                <dd>-"Contact" page: Contains text-boxes to get user's inputs later on.</dd> 
            </ul>          
            
            <p>That's it for now, enjoy (:</p>
